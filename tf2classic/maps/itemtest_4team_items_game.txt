// Welcome to the New-Old Weapons Pack!
//         | VERSION 2.3.5 | 
//				   -
//		   (For TF2C v2.0.3)
//--------------------------------------//
//
// Heya! Welcome to the main file (or, one of them) for the New-Old Weapons Pack!
//
// This file is the main meat of this mod - this is the bit that actually adds all the weapons to the game. 
// The rest of this mod's content you see in the .vpks and etc is mostly set dressing, but this all is important!
//
// I won't go too in-depth on how to format a new entry for a new weapon (you can look over the included tutorial for that!)
// HOWEVER, I'll have left many, MANY notations about aspects of weapon types, a specific weapon, or the process of making one of these weapons as Code Comments (like you can see below)
// If you've got the time, and are interesting in learning how these Weapons tick, and the process that went into them - I encourage reading through!
//
// Stuff is ordered in the general order I made them, if you need reference to when I made stuff.
// Walk in with an open mind, and hopefully you'll learn a lot!
//
//--------------------------------------//
//
// Personally, I think it's best for the folks of you that wish to make a weapon or weapons of their own to look through this, pick things up, and learn by doing it yourselves.
// I think earnestly each and every one of you could surely learn more from doing yourself than by asking me questions about it.
//
// Use Live TF2's and TF2C's default items_game.txt, my Attributes Listing and Items_Game Tutorial a few folders back, Google / Valve Developer Community Wiki searching, and your own intuition.
// Source is an old engine. No doubt, someone has asked the same kind of questions you've had - and had them answered. Broaden your search range - you can find help in unusual places.
//
// You can find the answer to your TF2 / TF2C questions in old posts about DOD:S or CSS. You can find engine tips from the depth of HL2 modding, or even sometimes Quake discussion. Hell, even esoteric file type might be used more commonly in other games, like Sonic Generations or PSO2.
// This was all to say, don't limit yourself to just TF2, and the answers will flow in as you search for them.
//
//
// Search, problem-solve, hypothesize on problems and test solutions for them. These are valuable life skills that you really can apply anywhere - even making new funny weapons for a TF2 Sourcemod.
// People might not always be around to help you in person, so take it into your own hands if you want something done, and something done well.
